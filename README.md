# kuona-project

Kuona is a data collection and visualisation tool for software development. Check out http://kuona.io for background on the project.

Currently there are no packages for download but there is a hosted example for some public open source projects at http://dashboard.kuona.io


## Developer workstation setup

Setting up for development should be fast. Ideally a single command. 

	git clone https://github.com/kuona/kuona-project.git
	cd kuona-project
	sh dev-setup

Once everything is setup use the build script to build all the components:

    ./build

Each project has its own readme file for further setup and build
instructions.
